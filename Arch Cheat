Connecting Bluetooth Devices and Mounting USB Sticks

To connect Bluetooth devices and mount USB sticks in Arch Linux, follow the steps below:

    Connect Bluetooth Devices:
        Make sure your Bluetooth adapter is enabled and functioning correctly.
        Open a terminal.

    Scan for Bluetooth devices:

    csharp

$ bluetoothctl
[bluetooth]# scan on

Wait for the list of devices to appear. Note the MAC address and name of the device you want to connect.

Pair and trust the device:

arduino

[bluetooth]# pair <device MAC address>
[bluetooth]# trust <device MAC address>

Connect to the device:

arduino

[bluetooth]# connect <device MAC address>

Once connected, you can use the Bluetooth device with your system.

Mount USB Sticks:

    Insert the USB stick into an available USB port.
    Open a terminal.

Check the device name of the USB stick:

ruby

$ lsblk

Identify the USB stick by its size or label. It is usually listed as something like /dev/sdX, where X is a letter representing the drive.

Create a mount point for the USB stick:

shell

# mkdir /mnt/usb

Mount the USB stick to the mount point:

shell

# mount /dev/sdX /mnt/usb

Replace /dev/sdX with the actual device name of the USB stick.

11. You can now access the contents of the USB stick at `/mnt/usb`
